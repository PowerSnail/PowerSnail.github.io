  year = {2022},
  abstract = {"In the ten years since publishing the groundbreaking New York Times bestseller Steal Like an Artist, Austin Kleon has become one of the most important names in creativity. His books have over a million copies in print and have been translated into dozens of languages; he's been featured on NPR's Morning Edition and the PBSNewsHour and in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal; and he's been praised as "brilliant" (New York) and "positively one of the most interesting people on the planet" (The Atlantic). We're now thrilled to celebrate this milestone and its significance with Steal Like an Artist: 10th Anniversary Edition. This hardcover gift edition has a larger trim, revised cover, ribbon marker, endpapers from the author's sketchbook, and a new Afterword. An inspiring guide to creativity in the digital age, Steal Like an Artist presents ten transformative principles to help readers discover their artistic side and build a more creative life. Its positive message, graphic look, and illustrations, exercises, and examples put readers directly in touch with their artistic side. We learn how to embrace influence, follow interests wherever they take us, forget old clich??s like writing about what you know-instead, write the book that you want to read, make the movie you want to watch. And above all, how to find the space you need to be wild and daring in your imagination and your work. In his Afterword, Kleon discusses the book's influence and how "stealing" has been misunderstood-providing a unique, personal perspective on a book that's touched so many over the past decade"--},

Surrounding the poem is a foreword and commentary by the demented scholar Charles Kinbote, who interweaves adoring literary analysis with the fantastical tale of an assassin from the land of Zembla in pursuit of a deposed king. Brilliantly constructed and wildly inventive, this darkly witty novel of suspense, literary one-upmanship, and political intrigue achieves that rarest of things in literature\textendash perfect tragicomic balance. With an introduction by Richard Rorty.},

  address = {{New York}},
  abstract = {One of the most valuable skills in our economy is becoming increasingly rare. If you master this skill, you'll achieve extraordinary results.  Deep work is the ability to focus without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It's a skill that allows you to quickly master complicated information and produce better results in less time. Deep work will make you better at what you do and provide the sense of true fulfillment that comes from craftsmanship. In short, deep work is like a super power in our increasingly competitive twenty-first century economy. And yet, most people have lost the ability to go deep-spending their days instead in a frantic blur of e-mail and social media, not even realizing there's a better way.  In DEEP WORK, author and professor Cal Newport flips the narrative on impact in a connected age. Instead of arguing distraction is bad, he instead celebrates the power of its opposite. Dividing this book into two parts, he first makes the case that in almost any profession, cultivating a deep work ethic will produce massive benefits. He then presents a rigorous training regimen, presented as a series of four "rules," for transforming your mind and habits to support this skill.   A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, DEEP WORK takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories -- from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air -- and no-nonsense advice, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. DEEP WORK is an indispensable guide to anyone seeking focused success in a distracted world.},

The story is set in the fictional town of St. Petersburg, inspired by Hannibal, Missouri, where Twain lived.Tom Sawyer lives with his Aunt Polly and his half-brother Sid. Tom dirties his clothes in a fight and is made to whitewash the fence the next day as punishment. He cleverly persuades his friends to trade him small treasures for the privilege of doing his work. He then trades the treasures for Sunday School tickets which one normally receives for memorizing verses, redeeming them for a Bible, much to the surprise and bewilderment of the superintendent who thought "it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused two thousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises\textemdash a dozen would strain his capacity, without a doubt."Tom falls in love with Becky Thatcher, a new girl in town, and persuades her to get "engaged" by kissing him. But their romance collapses when she learns Tom has been "engaged" previously to Amy Lawrence. Shortly after Becky shuns him, he accompanies Huckleberry Finn to the graveyard at night, where they witness the murder of Dr. Robinson.},
