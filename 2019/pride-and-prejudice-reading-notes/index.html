          Summary of <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>
          <a href="#summary-of-_pride-and-prejudice_"><small>##</small></a>
        </h2>
        <p>
          A young intelligent woman, Elizabeth, had a tendency to judge people
          quickly. Based on impressions and gossips, she deemed Mr. Darcy proud,
          cruel, and exploiting his friend. When Mr. Darcy expressed his
          affection to her, Elizabeth bashed him with criticism and sarcasm.
          However, after meeting Mr. Darcy and his family on a trip, she
          realized that she had rushed her opinions. She was misled by Mr.
          Wickham, whom she had deemed to be trustworthy but was actually a
          long-time liar. When she found out that she had misjudged so many
          people along the way, she confessed to Mr. Darcy: both her apologies
          and her own affection towards him. In the end, Mr. Darcy still loved
          her, and they got married.
        </p>
        <p>
          The storytelling was magnificent and humorous. Not only did Elizabeth
          misjudged the characters of people, but also I - the reader -
          misjudged along with her. I also thought in the beginning that Mr.
          Darcy was obnoxious proud. It&rsquo;s the way that author manipulated
          the narrative, showing only Elizabeth&rsquo;s perspective, that
          achieved this effect. There were many intelligent conversations, yet
          the characters were distinct. Each smart people had their own way of
          showing their intelligence, some by infallible arguments, some by
          sarcasms and jokes.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in
            possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          The beginning sentence has a witty humor behind it, which set the tone
          of the whole book. The sort of sarcastic, smart, biting comments were
          often laid by the narrator, by Elizabeth, or by her father Mr. Bennet.
          In fact, Mr. Bennet in the most of the book was hardly a fatherly
          figure. His love and biases towards the daughters were apparent.
          However, when his least favorite daughter was potentially in danger,
          his worry and actions spoke for his actual feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mr. Bennet had been an observer to the story for the majority of the
          book. He saw his own family and the world in a very picky lens; he did
          not participate in activities much; even when he did, he would take
          the chance to mock someone. The author might have projected herself
          onto this character, so she could point out ironies and mock the
          stupidity of people in a more engaging way.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>Compliments always take you by surprise, and me never.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Elizabeth inherited Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s humor, but added a self-mocking
          element to it. She often criticized herself and laughed about herself.
          She sometimes makes harsh judgments against herself, and sometimes
          makes fun of flaws in her own personality. Compared with Mr.
          Bennet&rsquo;s stinging sarcasm, Elizabeth was humbler, yet prouder in
          herself at the same time.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Pride,&rdquo; observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the
            solidity of her reflections,&ldquo;is a very common failing, Vanity
            and pride are different things, though the words are often used
            synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride
            relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would
            have others think of us.&rdquo;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Mary is the other side of the author&rsquo;s voice. In contrast to how
          mocking was expressed through Mr. Bennet&rsquo;s mouth, the serious
          morals were delivered by Mary the nerd.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; replied Darcy, to whom this remark was
            chiefly addressed, &ldquo;there is a meanness in all the arts which
            ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever
            bears affinity to cunning is despicable.&rdquo;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Mr. Darcy was also smart and not stingy on his criticisms. But he did
          not use the deliberate sarcasm like Mr. Bennet. Mr. Darcy was too
          proud of himself to spend effort in crafting witty attacks just for
          the sake of mocking people. He was much more blunt in his criticism,
          while Mr. Bennet would go through winding roads that catch people by
          surprise. It was not in his character to deliberately hurt people,
          although at this point of the book, the real detailed Mr. Darcy had
          yet to be shown. His remarks were not lacking of intelligence,
          however. It originated from his clear mind, observant nature, and his
          pride to not losing an argument.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &ldquo;…… Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it be
            only a slight, thin sort of inclination, I am convinced that one
            good sonnet will starve it entirely away.&rdquo;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p><em>(said by Mr. Darcy)</em></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &ldquo;Nothing is more deceitful,&rdquo; said Darcy, &ldquo;than the
            appearance of humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion,
            and sometimes an indirect boast.&rdquo;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &quot; Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride — where there is
            a real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good
            regulation.&quot;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Mr. Darcy never hid his pride. He was so proud that even pride itself
          was to be proud of. The above quotes outlined that part of his
          character in clarity.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            &ldquo;An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this
            day you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will
            never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will
            never see you again if you do.&rdquo;
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          Almost anything could be seen as a joke to Mr. Bennet. He was like an
          old monk who had seen everything in the world, and therefore no longer
          find anything worthy of excitement (though he was quite disturbed
          later when Lydia was lost). Unlike a monk though, he loved to make fun
          of people.

          <p>
            There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of whom I
            think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I dissatisfied
            with it; and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of
            all human characters, and of the little dependence that can be
            placed on the appearance of merit or sense.

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours ; whenever she was
            alone, she gave way to it as the greatest relief ; and not a day
            went by without a solitary walk, in which she might indulge in all
            the delight of unpleasant recollections.

            a servant comprehends every virtue.&rdquo;

        <blockquote>

            Assistance is impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph
