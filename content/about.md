This blog is created with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The theme is derived from the minimalist [MVP.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/), combined with a clean Hugo theme: [Rocinante Theme](https://github.com/mavidser/hugo-rocinante).

On the top of this page, is the manuscript of Bach's Sarabande in B Minor, from one of his famous [violin sonatas and partitas](https://imslp.org/wiki/6_Violin_Sonatas_and_Partitas%2C_BWV_1001-1006_(Bach%2C_Johann_Sebastian)).
