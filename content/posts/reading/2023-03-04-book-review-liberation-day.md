_Liberation Day_ is a collection of nine short stories, a set of Dystopian-feeling, but ultimately empathetic narratives, spanning from the realistic to the surreal and the fantastic. Generally speaking, Saunders creates characters that in the core of their heart want to be good. They have the strong desire to do the right thing, to do a good job, and to not disappoint has an innocent purity, which, even when hindered by the difficulty of life, misdirected by technologically forced mind washing, even when the characters make the wrong decision, or when they are ultimately defeated, still shines through.

The magical ingredient of Saunders's writing is his ability to blend the paradoxical qualities into a coherent piece. In the darkest stories, we see humor. In the funny moments, we taste bitterness. Dire situations breed pure souls. From good intentions, bad decisions are made. The human-robot creature that seems smartest in the beginning turns out to be the one who stops their own liberation, and only when the hope of liberty is gone, realization dawns on him, too late.

Despite being fantasy stories, there aren't outrageous expositions. Instead, the world building is sparse(a lot of trust is put into the reader), and often revealed from what the characters can _feel_ and what they _think_, rather than through static descriptions. For instance,

> "All day we wonder: When will Mr. U. return? To Podium? [...] When next will be asked to Speak? Of what, in what flavor?"

I think these snippets work, because first, they sound like legitimate questions that the character would potentially "wonder" about in their situation, rather than unreasonably descriptive monologues, and second, the texts don't expound. Instead, the stream-of-consciousness throws out only hints, often marked by the idiosyncratic use of capitalization, punctuation, and other layout oddities, that at this stage are more like questions than answers to the reader, inviting the reader to fill in the blanks themselves. It reminds me of what Saunders calls "TICHN"---"things I couldn't help noticing"---in _A Swim in a Pond in the Rain_ when he talks about classic short stories by Russian writers, and how good stories leave the reader wondering about some TICHN at the end of each page, which is what motivates the reader to go on reading in search of an answer. This is the type of fantasy world building that I like the most: it makes me ask "why?", "how?", and "what?", especially in short stories where every word counts.

## Conclusion

Highly recommend. Among the nine stories, my favorite ones are the titular "Liberation Day", "Ghoul", and "Love Letter".
