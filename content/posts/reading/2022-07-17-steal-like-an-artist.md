## Summary

A short, inspirational book about how to be a productive artist. The first few chapters are about imitation, the necessity of it, and how to evolve from there. The author talks about graduating from imitating to emulating: from copying what your heroes make, to copying what your heroes see and hear, which is how "stealing" can be incorporated into the process of making original art.

Later, the book offers some practical tips on gathering inspirations: "use your hand", keep hobbies, share, travel, be nice to people, stay out of fights, have daily, regular routines, and put strategic constraints on yourself.

An interesting quote:

> “Complain about the way other people make software by making software.”

## Thoughts

It's always fascinating when artists talking about their own process, the way each artist find their own authenticity, the source of originality. Neil Gaiman talked about confluence. Here, Austin Kleon talks about imitation and graduating from imitation. 

Create what you like. Write the book that you would want to read. Make the software that you'd like to use.

Creating what you like is in itself a form of imitation, since your taste is formed by appreciating existing arts. This warm and inviting advice deviates from the traditional and stern directive that writers sometimes throw about: "Write what you know", and I think the deviation is a valuable one.

Indeed, writing what you know is not the best writing advice out there. Imagination and words doesn't come from nowhere; they grow from what's in your brain, so in a way, regardless of what you write, you are writing what you know. It's not really a meaningful guideline. It's an inevitability. On the other hand, it can also be perceived to mean something else: you shouldn't write about something that you're not familiar with, which is just unnecessarily limiting, and obviously not true considering how many great fictions contain utterly fictional world and creatures.
