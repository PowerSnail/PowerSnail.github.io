## The Good

1. Keyboard Navigation
2. Clean interface
3. One reader for all reading materials: RSS, Read-it-later, e-books
4. Decent apps
5. Support for importing from a large variety of sources


## The Counter-arguments

4. Much more expensive than competing solutions. Instapaper is several times cheaper and offers similar functions with regard to saving and highlighting web pages.
5. RSS has no hierarchical organization
