Nathan Cole was trying to fix a student's _staccato_ during one of his masterclasses. There was a _piano_ note after series of _staccato_, and she had the problem with "landing" that note lightly. Nathan offered the following insight (paraphrased): don't think of it as landing, and engage the pinky to lighten weight of the bow, instead of only raising the arm, so the bow keeps its angle constant. 

While I'm not currently doing staccato in my practice, Nathan's lesson on pinky engagement illuminates on another problem: shaky down bow.

There are two common advices about bow change: the most popular painter's hand, which enoucrages a soft, flexible wrist as if painting a wall with a brush; and the method that supposedly belongs to Nathan Milstein: "I move it in one direction and then I move it back in the opposite direction."[^1] The latter sounds great but offers no practical guidance. The former, while widely adopted, could put the emphasis on the wrong part of the movement.

Focusing on the soft wrist gave me the impression that it is a wrist-centric action. The wrist makes a move, and the rest of the hand follows that same flex. However, I ignored the balance of the bow. Too much softening means that the fingers no longer exerts the same amount of the force to the bow stick, so the frog is a little bit lighter. But gravity never relents, keeping a constant pull at the center of mass, so overall, the bow rotates in that moment of flexing, like a slight nodding. When the bow nods, the tip is lower and the frog is higher, so for a brief moment, the hair is less engaged with the string, and at the next moment, re-engages the string harder. Sort of like a tiny flap of a wave hitting the rock, and bouncing off into the air. That extra upward force propagates through the stick, causing the infamous down bow bounce.

Engaging the pinky is part of the broader principle of keeping the bow hold consistent throughout the bow change. This is not some new lesson; but it does point me to heed the key spot. When I start to notice the pinky's force, the entire balance of the bow change feels different, more stable, more controlled. 

We all talk about the wrist, because the wrist's action is visually salient, but it's the fingers who keep the bow steady.
