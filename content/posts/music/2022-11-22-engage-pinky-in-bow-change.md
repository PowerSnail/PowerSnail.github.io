Nathan Cole was trying to fix a student's _staccato_ during one of his masterclasses. There was a _piano_ note after series of _staccato_, and she had the problem with "landing" that note lightly. Nathan offered the following insight (paraphrased): don't think of it as landing, and engage the pinky to lighten weight of the bow, instead of only raising the arm, so the bow keeps its angle constant. 

While I'm not currently doing staccato in my practice, Nathan's lesson on pinky engagement illuminates on another problem: shaky down bow.

There are two common advices about bow change: the most popular painter's hand, which encourages a soft, flexible wrist as if painting a wall with a brush; and the method that supposedly belongs to Nathan Milstein: "I move it in one direction, and then I move it back in the opposite direction" [^1]. The latter sounds great but offers no practical guidance. The former, while widely adopted, could put the emphasis on the wrong part of the movement.

Focusing on the soft wrist gives me the impression that it is a wrist-centric action. The wrist makes a move, and the rest of the hand follows. Too much flex in the fingers means that they no longer exerts the same amount of the force to the bow stick, so the frog is a little lighter, while unrelenting gravity keeps a constant pull at the center of mass, rotating the bow like a slight nodding. When the bow nods, the tip is lower and the frog is higher, so for a brief moment, the hair is less engaged with the string, and at the next moment, re-engages the string harder. Sort of like a tiny flap of a wave hitting the rock, and bouncing off into the air. That extra upward force propagates through the stick, causing the infamous down bow bounce.

By engaging the pinky---more concretely, exerting the pinky to resist the frog from rising---the bow can be kept straight. It's a somewhat paradoxical sensation: from a physical point of view, we want the force to be constant. But because the natural tendency is to lighten, I feel that the pinky needs to be proactively forceful in that split second, to keep the bow straight. Our perception of force and movement don't always match reality, so to achieve a desired result, sometimes we have to change our perspective and "cheat" our brain. Choosing the right perspective and the right metaphor is the magic ingredient of a great teacher.
