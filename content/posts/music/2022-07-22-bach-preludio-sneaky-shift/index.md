*Preludio* (*Prelude* in some version) is one of Bach's best violin pieces. From measure 17 to 28, a bariolage among three strings brings us a sublime polyphonic experience, with only single notes played detaché. The bowing is tricky, especially at speed, but I want to talk about the left hand.

From measure 20 to 28, the left hand descends one position every two measures. The most straightforward way is to shift at the beginning of measure 21, 23, 25, 27, and 28, using the third finger on A string, so your first finger is always playing the root note on D string.

The open string E gives us an opportunity to fully hide this shift, however. In measure 20, we begin with 1st finger on C♯, 2nd finger on A. If we don't shift, we'll begin measure 21 with 2nd finger, too. Then, when the bow is hitting the open E, let the hand shift on position, and press the 3rd finger on A. If you can shift within the duration of that E, there will be no audible shift.

Then, in the measure 22, no shift is needed. In measure 23, begin with 2nd finger on G♯, shift during the open string E, and end with 3rd finger on G♯. So on, and so on.

There are many opportunities in this piece to use the sneaky shift. Measure 67 begins a bariolage that exactly mirrors this sections on the lower strings, so does the technique. The two-string bariolages, like the ones from measure 13~16, also have a few places for sneaky shift.

Exploiting an open string for sneaky shift is a common technique when designing one's fingering. It's especially helpful when you are looking for a clean sound.
