## A Warm-up for Chords

To roll a chord on the violin is a complex issue: the timing of your movement from string to string will change the texture of the sound, giving emphasis to different notes, and generating different momentum. Even after years of playing, I still mess up when I play a chord-rich piece like Bach.

One of the problems that I face, is finding the right bowing plane. There are roughly speaking 7 planes in violin bowing (if we disregard triple stops): G, GD, D, DA, A, AE, and E. When you play on a single string, there is a bit of wiggle room. When you play double-stops, the bow must stay at the plane steadily and accurately. A little deviation from the plane will cause the sound to suffer.

So this is a little warm-up exercise that I use to prepare myself for chord-extensive pieces. It gives some anchors to where each plane is.

## Exercise One

![Legato Exercise](/images/bow-planes-exercise-legato.svg)

First, play a simple legato exercise, connecting each plane to the next. Keep your upper body upright, and let your elbow anticipate the change. The aim of this exercise is to find where the planes are, and get used to moving between them swiftly.

When you cross from a single string to a double-stop, the double-stop must immediately ring. For instance, when crossing from G to GD, you must hear both G and D equally well. If D is airy, the elbow hasn't dropped far enough. If G is airy, the elbow has dropped too far. The same principle applies for when crossing from GD to D. G must stop immediately. Do not hesitate. If you hear any muddiness, re-do the pair of crossings.

Now, the overall tempo should be slow. What needs to be fast is the action of changing the plane. It's as if you are snapping into a magnetic rail. Look at [Hilary Hahn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_80s85N9e-0). The music is slow and smooth, but see how her bow arm is always swift at string crossings. 

## Exercise Two: Dotted Rhythm

When breaking a chord, we must choose where and when to move from one plane to the next. An early break can make the chord sound more unified and with a stronger momentum. A late break put more emphasis on the first few notes, which is crucial for phrasing in some situations.

But to make such a choice, you have to first be able to break the chord anywhere on the bow. In his masterclass, soloist Kerson Leung instructed a student do a simple exercise for Bach: break the chord as early as you can; shorten the lower notes as much as possible, while still make them ring. Now the aim of course is not to play every chord as curtly. But when you can break the chord cleanly with just 1 cm of the bow, you can break the chord anywhere.

We can reify this exercise with dotted rhythm. Again, play with the same requirement as the first exercise: clean, immediate string crossing. Increase the dotted duration as needed.
