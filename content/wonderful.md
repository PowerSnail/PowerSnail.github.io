title: Wonderful stuff
description: A list of miscellaneous software, websites, and physical items that I really enjoy using.

We have too many things. We have so many things, that trying to choose is becoming difficult, because even to survey all the options on a surface level is too overwhelming a task. To choose wisely, we rely on each other's knowledge.

So, here are some things that I enjoy. For each item, I provide a reason for liking it. I include only the things that I've personally used for quite some time, and I'm going to avoid listing anything that is the default, the obvious, or too broadly famous, lest this page becomes yet another _Awesome List_. (What's the point of yet another article recommending `virtualenv` to a python developer, or Hugo to a blog writer?)

I have no association with any of the projects or products. Just a happy user.

Table of content:

| Item              | Category | Summary                        |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------ |
| Topgrade          | CLI      | One command updates everything |
| KIYA Nail Clipper | Tool     | A well-made nail clipper       |


### Topgrade

[Topgrade](https://github.com/r-darwish/topgrade) is a CLI command that updates everything that can be upgraded on your system. 

There are way too many upgradeable things in a modern OS: your distro's package manager, language-specific package manager which the devs love but everyone else hates, the new kid on the block called flatpak, firmware, etc. There are things that I don't even know can be updated. 

Topgrade is that "update now" button for the CLI, which also provides more transparency than its GUI equivalents. Rather than an opaque progress bar that can't predict the remaining time and a percentage number that nobody understands, it simply prints the output of the corresponding command. I know what it is doing. It's exactly as if I've typed those commands myself, but more exhaustively and with less work.


### KIYA Nail Clipper

It's just a regular nail clipper, that is very well-made. It's sharp, solidly built, compactly shaped, easy to use, durable (I've had one for years), and easy to carry (no weird, protruding shape). For violin playing, I have to trim my nails very often, and this is the most comfortable nail clipper I've ever used.
