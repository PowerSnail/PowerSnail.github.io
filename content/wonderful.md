title: Wonderful stuff
description: A list of miscellaneous software, websites, and physical items that I really enjoy using.

We have too many things. We have so many things, that trying to choose is becoming difficult, because even to survey all the options on a surface level is too overwhelming a task. To choose wisely, we rely on each other's knowledge.

So, here are some things that I enjoy. For each item, I provide a reason for liking it. I include only the things that I've personally used for quite some time, and I'm going to avoid listing anything that is the default, the obvious, or too broadly famous, lest this page becomes yet another _Awesome List_. (What's the point of yet another article recommending `virtualenv` to a python developer, or Hugo to a blog writer?)

I have no association with any of the projects or products. Just a happy user.

Table of content:

| Item                            | Category |
| ------------------------------- | -------- |
| `llm`                           | Software |
| `ripgrep`                       | Software |
| `zoxide`                        | Software |
| `fd`                            | Software |
| `jq`                            | Software |
| Tuner by thetwom                | Software |
| KIYA Nail Clipper               | Tool     |
| Pilot Metropolitan Fountain Pen | Tool     |

## `llm`

This is a really cool CLI interface for various LLM providers, including locally hosted ones, written by [Simon Willison](https://simonwillison.net/). I almost use it daily now. I really like the design where you can provide the prompt as an argument, pipe content into `stdin`, or actually do both at the same time, avoiding a lot of bash tricks for concatenation, which I never properly remembers when I need it.

## `ripgrep`

`rg` is the 5th most invoked command in my shell history. It's a semi-replacement of `grep`, (semi-, because it doesn't try to be compatible with all the flags), and in my opinion, it provides better defaults than `grep`, e.g. the matching pattern is regex by default, rather than glob.

## `zoxide`

It enables you to "cd" into a directory anywhere (not just in current directory), by fuzzy matching the history of all directories that have accessed. It supports many shells---fish for me---and it works out of the box.

## `fd`

A semi-replacement for `find`, that provides, similar to `rg`, much more ergonomic defaults, in my opinion.

## `jq`

`jq` provides a CLI interface for JSON files (parsing, getting a field, filtering a list, replacing values, etc.). The use case is endless, since nowadays, everything works with JSON.

## Tuner

The Tuner app I use for tuning the violin. It's intuitive to read, has a clean interface, no ads, no bullshit; and it is open source, available on F-Droid.

## KIYA Nail Clipper

It's just a regular nail clipper, that is very well-made. It's sharp, solidly built, compactly shaped, easy to use, durable (I've had one for years), and easy to carry (no weird, protruding shape). For violin playing, I have to trim my nails very often, and this is the most comfortable nail clipper I've ever used.

## Pilot Metropolitan Fountain Pen

I bought one in the university book shop on the first day of arriving as a freshman. At the time, I thought the violet, metallic color was pretty, and the price tag (around $15 I remember) attractive to a student, and it surprised me with how well it wrote, very smooth, with the right amount of friction, and a good balance in hand. Now a decade later, after stacks of notebooks and diaries being filled, I still have the same one, which has never jammed or leaked, and there is no signs of wear to be found.
