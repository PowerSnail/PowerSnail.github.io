## 1.1 Introduction



### lesson notes




1. Content is most important thing for clear passage
2. Logic thinking.
3. Learnable rules of style

_What else to do?_

    * Pay attention to the 'tricks' writers use
    * Imitate
* Write journals

* Academic writings habits might be not good

* Try not to bore the readers

* Prepared, not special inspiration

* 心理准备: writing is hard for everyone

* First draft is never perfect -> **revise**

* Cut ruthlessly

---
### My comments:

A checklist of things I have to do:

| Check |
|-------|
|read more, and **look for** skills of a good essay|
|Add interesting elements into my writings|
|Once prepared, Start Right away.|
|Write out whatever sh*t I am writing, and revise it later. (大胆往下写，莫回头啊莫回头)|
|Delete harshly.|

## 1.2 Something to Avoid

### lesson notes

Some questions:

* easy to read?
* enjoyable and interesting?
* to inform or to **obscure**?

A **bad** habit in academic writings:

> Verb -> noun

Complex idea != complex writing

---
### My comments

1. Don't write too complicated sentences
2. Verb > noun (-tion, -ing, etc)

## 1.3 Some principles

### lesson notes


#### More bad features:

* nouns rather than verbs

* vague words: "physiologic"

* unnecessary jargon and acronyms:

    * `microRNA` -> `miR`
    * if it is made up, then readers have to _adjust to_ the acronym
    * only the very conventional acronyms should be used.

* passive voice

* The **distance** between the subject and **main verb** is too far
*

#### Principles

1. Cut unnecessary words and phrases
2. active voice
3. use **verb**

### My comments

Could be a revision checklist:

|+|check|
|--|-----|
|1. |remove unnecessary adj.|
|2. |move verb and subject close|
|3. |use active voice if possible|
|4. |`-tion, -ing` into verbs|

## 1.3 Cutting Clutters

### lesson notes

#### Example 1:

|original | cut |
|---|---|
|provides a review|reviews|
|the basic tenets of cancer... | cancer...|
|illustrate xxx or demonstrate xxx| illustrate xxx and xxx|

Original:

> This paper provides a review of the basic tenets of cancer biology study design, using as examples studies that illustrate the methodologic challenges or that demonstrate successful solutions to the difficulties inherent in biological research.

changed:

> This paper reveiws cancer biology study design, using examples that illustrate specific challenges and solutions.

#### Example 2:

|original |cut|
|---|---|
|As it is well known| omitted|
|has been related to a profile of|is associated with|

#### Example 3:

|original |cut|
|---|---|
|experimental demonstartion| experiments|
|for the concept|omitted|


#### Cut Ruthlessly

Try to cut first. (yes, at least **try**)

#### Common clutter

1. Dead words:
    * as it is shown...
    * as it is well known...
    * it should be emphasized that...
2. Empty words and phrases:
    * basic tenets of
    * concept of...
3. Long words
4. Unnecessary jargon and acronym
    * miR
5. Repetitive
    * challenges/difficulties
    * successful solutions
6. adverbs
    * very, really, quite, basically, generally, etc.

|wordy version| crisp version|
|---|---|
|A majority of|most|
|a number of |many|
|Are of the same opinion|agree|
|less frequently occurring|rare|
|all three of the|the three|
|give rise to|cause|
|due to the fact that|because|
|...|...|

The ultimate thing to do is to shorten your writing.

### My comments:

Most essential ones for me:

1. adverbs
2. repetition
3. dead words

$$
\begin{align}
  \text{logMar} & = & \log_{10}\text{Mar}
\end{align}
$$
