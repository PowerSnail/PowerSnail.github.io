"Sugar? Cream? Milk?"

"No, thanks. I like black coffee."

In Los Angeles, the hostess offered me coffee every morning, straight from the electric coffee machine, made from pre-grounds inside giant buckets. It was a harsh cup of coffee. There was a cutting edge to its mouth feel, a sort of burnt smell, not just bitter or intense, but harsh. She was the best kind of hostess, hospitable, made great breakfast with bacon and potatoes. But the coffee was bad. 

For years, I've ground and brewed my own coffee in a simple plastic V60. Different beans, different flavor, different aroma, but the same overall shape of smoothness and clarity. To me, coffee was both something I like, and something mundane. Only after the harsh cup in LA did I reunite with my coffee-related excitement.

Sometimes, it takes a bad cup of coffee to remind ourselves what good coffee tastes like.

## How do I make coffee

After a craze of shopping tools and experimentation, I came to a simple approach with my coffee making.

I mostly use dark roasted beans, ground to the size of table salt.

The apparatus is a clear plastic V60, a paper filter, pre-rinsed, placed on top of a mug.

I put about 16~18 grams of coffee in the cone, make a little dimple in the middle, and pour about 50 grams of water for the bloom. Let it rest for half a minute after a gentle shake. Then, pour 100 grams of water, and maintain the water level with intermittent pours, until the target weight is achieved. I usually use 16:1 water to coffee ratio.
