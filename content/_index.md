I am PowerSnail. This is where I write, about programming, music, cooking, and reading. Blogging is a form of daydream: the blissful indulgence of an imagined audience, like a snail who climbs to the top of a grass blade, raising its tentacles into the wind, as if it has a voice that resounds through the whole world.
