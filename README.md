## About this blog

Operating since 1995, I have been mostly healthy and required rare maintenances. I've grown into a programmer, a music lover, and an enthusiastic cook.

I made this blog with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). The theme is derived from the minimalist [MVP.css](https://andybrewer.github.io/mvp/), combined with a clean Hugo theme: [Rocinante Theme](https://github.com/mavidser/hugo-rocinante). The icons are from the great [Tabler Icons](https://tablericons.com/) project.

On the top of this page, is the manuscript of Bach's Sarabande in B Minor, from one of his famous [Six Sonatas and Partitas for Solo Violin](<https://imslp.org/wiki/6_Violin_Sonatas_and_Partitas%2C_BWV_1001-1006_(Bach%2C_Johann_Sebastian)>). This is my favorite piece to play on the violin.
