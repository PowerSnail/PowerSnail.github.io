## The Apple Boxes Problem

The problem can be simply put:

> Input: $$k$$
>
> Output: let $$r$$ be the sum of the square of each *even*  integer no larger than $$k$$, and $$y$$ be that of the *odd*. Return $r - y$.

## The Naive Solution

We can loop through 1 to $$k$$, alternating between adding and subtracting.

```python
val = 0
for i in [1..k]
    if i % 2 == 0
        val += i * i
    else
        val -= i * i

return val
```

There could be various optimizations, but nevertheless, the algorithm is linear with regards to $$k$$.

## Constant Solution

First, assume $$k$$ is even, so that we can perfectly pair up terms in $$r$$ and $$y$$. Observe that each pair is in the form of $$x^2 - (x - 1)^2$$. This can be transformed to $$(x + x - 1)\cdot(x - x + 1) = (x - 1) + x$$. When we add all pairs, it becomes a simple series: $$1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k$$. For example, for $$k = 6$$:

$$
\begin{align*}
r &= 2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2 \\
y &= 1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2 \\
r - y &= (2^2 + 4^2 + 6^2) - (1^2 + 3^2 + 5^2) \\
    &= (2^2 - 1^2) + (4^2 - 2^2) + (6^2 - 5^2) \\
    &= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 \\
    &= \dfrac{6(1 + 6)}{2} \\
    &= 21
\end{align*}
$$

Thus, we can return $$\dfrac{k(1 + k)}{2}$$ for arbitrary _even_ $$k$$.

What about _odd_ $$k$$? We can adjust the pairing a little bit, and easily find that now we have $$-\dfrac{k(1 + k)}{2}$$.

## C++ Source Code

```cpp
int appleBoxes(int k) {
    int sum =  (1 + k) * k / 2
    return (k % 2 == 1) ? -sum : sum;
}
```
