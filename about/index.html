  About this blog
  <a href="#about-this-blog"><small>##</small></a>
</h2>
<p>I made this blog with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> plus a bunch of post-processing scripts that supplement what Hugo doesn&rsquo;t easily provide, for example, inserting citations and references using CSL, and generating multiple responsive images of various size.</p>
<p>After looking over several options, I came to the conclusion that 3rd-party comment section provider is not worth the effort. They are, most of the time, not friendly to privacy and anonymity. They also almost always require a lot of JavaScript to work. The blog has a low traffic, and the vast majority of that traffic would not be interested in commenting, so all that JavaScript is just wasted. To comment, send me an email via the address at the bottom of each post, and if anybody does so, I will manually append the comment to the page, anonymously be default, unless the commenter includes their name in the body of the email itself.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect the code of this site to be particularly interesting to a broad audience, since it is all written in a way that is highly specific to this site, a bunch of python scripts glued together by a <code>justfile</code>, so hacky that it would not be generalizable. I had to write my own reload.js, so it would work with the rest of the pipeline. Nonetheless, here are the <a href="https://github.com/PowerSnail/PowerSnail.github.io">code</a>.</p>
<p>The fonts used on this site are <a href="https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/bitter-ht">Bitter Pro</a> for serif (this is most of texts on this site), <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> for sans serif, <a href="https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode">Fira Code</a> for monospace, and <a href="https://fonts.google.com/noto">Noto Sans SC</a> for Chinese characters.
