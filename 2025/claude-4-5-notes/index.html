        <div id="title-subtitle">
          Claude Haiku 4.5 is released; here are some quotes and reading notes
          of mine.
        </div>

        <p>
          On 2025-10-16, Claude Haiku 4.5 was released. It is a smaller, faster
          model than the previously released Claude Sonnet 4.5.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here are the release notes:
          <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5"
            >https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-haiku-4-5</a
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          The claim is that Haiku 4.5 is on par with GPT-5 Codex on SWE-bench.
          This is quite interesting, as in my experience GPT-5 Codex is
          incredibly slow for complex tasks, but that extra time seems useful,
          as it produces more accurate results. I&rsquo;m curious whether Haiku
          4.5 performs as well on those kinds of tasks as GPT-5 Codex, but
          faster, though I&rsquo;m doubtful.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, even if it is not as good for large, complex tasks, it might
          still be useful for completing shorter tasks. If we use GPT-5 Codex as
          the orchestrator, which then dispatches Haiku 4.5 to write individual
          functions, we might get a speed boost while keeping the benefit of
          GPT-5 Codex&rsquo;s higher-level insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared with its predecessor, Haiku 3.5, Anthropic claims that Haiku
          4.5 offers better capabilities in agentic coding and computer use (for
          example, operating browsers). Anthropic acknowledges that the model is
          not a &ldquo;frontier&rdquo; model but is suitable for agentic work,
          which suggests that Anthropic encourages the same kind of architecture
          where a large model serves as the orchestrator and a smaller model
          handles lower-level work.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            It is not a frontier model, but its high levels of intelligence and
            speed make it appropriate for a wide variety of “agentic” uses,
            including where multiple instances of the model complete tasks in
            parallel.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Haiku 4.5 is also supposed to have better safety and alignment.</p>
        <p>
          Haiku 4.5 provides an &ldquo;extended thinking mode&rdquo; in which it
          follows a chain of thought before replying. I think the reason more
          models (even smaller, faster models) are becoming
          &ldquo;reasoning&rdquo; models is that accuracy on complex problems
          requires more time and tokens. To alleviate this slowness, Anthropic
          launches another instance of Haiku 4.5 to summarize the thoughts if
          the chain of thought gets too long.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            [&hellip;] agentic episodes in reinforcement learning more
            frequently encounter physical context-window limits.
          </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          This is an interesting observation, and their solution is to make the
          model &ldquo;aware&rdquo; of this limitation during training. They
          claim that the model becomes more careful about when to &ldquo;wrap
          things up&rdquo; as the limit approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had once before encountered agents exhausting the context window
          when porting a Next.js backend to Python with GPT-5 Codex. I&rsquo;m
          not sure this awareness will help, as I suspect that when dealing with
          tasks that involve a huge amount of input (e.g., coding in a large
          codebase), the application layer must also take responsibility for
          feeding data into the model more judiciously. At least the model
          probably won&rsquo;t exhaust its context window by outputting too
          much.
