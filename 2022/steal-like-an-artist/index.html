          Summary

        </h2>
        <p>
          A short, inspirational book about how to be a productive artist. The
          first few chapters are about imitation, the necessity of it, and how
          to evolve from there. The author talks about graduating from imitating
          to emulating: from copying what your heroes make, to copying what your
          heroes see and hear, which is how &ldquo;stealing&rdquo; can be
          incorporated into the process of making original art.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, the book offers some practical tips on gathering inspirations:
          &ldquo;use your hand&rdquo;, keep hobbies, share, travel, be nice to
          people, stay out of fights, have daily, regular routines, and put
          strategic constraints on yourself.
        </p>
        <p>An interesting quote:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>
            “Complain about the way other people make software by making
            software.” —Andre Torrez
          </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
          It&rsquo;s always fascinating when artists talking about their own
          process, the way each artist find their own authenticity, the source
          of originality. Neil Gaiman talked about confluence. Here, Austin
          Kleon talks about imitation and graduating from imitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Create what you like. Write the book that you would want to read. Make
          the software that you&rsquo;d like to use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creating what you like is in itself a form of imitation, since your
          taste is formed by appreciating existing arts. This warm and inviting
          advice deviates from the traditional and stern directive that writers
          sometimes throw about: &ldquo;Write what you know&rdquo;, and I think
          the deviation is a valuable one.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are different interpretations of &ldquo;writing what you
          know&rdquo;, (some would insist that you should never make things up
          when you include something from the real world in your fiction), but
          if you think about it, all we <em>can</em> write, is what we know.
          Like J.R.R. Tolkein said, &ldquo;there is no &lsquo;invention&rsquo;
          in the void&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s not much of a guideline for writers.
          It&rsquo;s just the nature of our thought process.
        </p>
        <p>
          That&rsquo;s why to &ldquo;create what you like&rdquo; is a better
          advice. It actually tells you how to narrow down your choice. From the
          vast gallery of life experiences, pick the ones that you enjoy the
          most, immerse yourself in it, and make something out of it.
        </p>
