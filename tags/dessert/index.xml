&lt;p>My recipe is loosely adapted from &lt;a href="https://www.askchefdennis.com/the-best-tiramisu-you-will-ever-make">this recipe&lt;/a>, with sparks of inspiration collected from here and there.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-cream">The Cream&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To me, the essence of tiramisu is mascarpone. The creamy, milky fragrance, and the smooth texture are what make tiramisu so delicious and rich. Some recipes use additional heavy creams, but it&amp;rsquo;s unnecessary. Mascarpone is made from cream; all the flavors you like about cream are already inside mascarpone. Just buy enough mascarpone, and you have one less thing to whip.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To make the creamy curd of tiramisu, first whip 4 egg yolks in a double boiler. Prepare a small pot with a bit of water, bring it up to a boil, and turn the heat down to a simmer. Place a bowl above the steam, and whisk the egg yolk for about 10 minutes, until it&amp;rsquo;s thick, viscous, and of a lighter color. Gradually add 60g of sugar during the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve found that adding all the sugar at once can make the whipping process very awkward, especially with non-fine sugar. The mixture becomes simultaneously sandy and liquidy, which not very easy to work with. So, I add sugar in 3 batches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While waiting for the yolks to cool down, whisk the mascarpone just a little, so it&amp;rsquo;s fluffier. It&amp;rsquo;s very easy to over-whisk mascarpone, so be careful. Fold in the yolks when they are cooled to room temperature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Optionally, drop a pinch of salt into the egg whites, whisk it to a stiff peak, and fold it into the cream as well. The whites have no flavor; all it does is to firm up the texture, and dilute the sweetness.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="coffee">Coffee&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Prepare 250g of coffee. Instant coffee works. As a coffee lover, this is not something that I thought I was ever going to say; but for tiramisu, it absolutely works. Double the powder to water ratio, so it&amp;rsquo;s strong enough. Or if you have an espresso machine, that&amp;rsquo;s even better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For extra fragrance, I steeped a bag of Earl Grey in the hot coffee for 2 minutes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Add a teaspoon of whatever liquor you like. Or if you are like me, who cannot drink actual alcohol, a few drops of rum extract works wonders.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="assembly">Assembly&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Roll the ladyfingers in the coffee, and place them nicely in a layer. They should be just wet enough, so that there&amp;rsquo;s enough liquid to work their way to the core over the next few hours, but not so much that the whole piece is dripping.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On top them, spread a thick layer of cream. And layer the ladyfingers and creams until everything is used up.&lt;/p>
